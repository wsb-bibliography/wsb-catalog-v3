  First. Per the London bookseller Any Amount of Books: "From the working
  library of novelist Angela Carter (1940 - 1992) with her posthumous
  bookplate. This small, attractive bookplate reads 'From the Library of
  Angela Carter' and was designed by Sebastian Carter of the Rampant Lions
  Press and was authorised by the executors of her estate, from whom we bought
  the major part of her considerable collection. Fine in fine dust wrapper."
