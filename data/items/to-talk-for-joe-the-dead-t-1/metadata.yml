  "to talk for Joe the Dead" - Typescript
date: 1983
description: >-
  Per Brian Cassidy: "[1pp. Typed MSS With Holograph Corrections and Notes
  From His Short Story 'to talk for Joe the Dead'].  1983.  4to. Very good or
  better; mild toning along edges where framed mat once was, tape remnant from
  same to top edge.  Both unobtrusive. Single manuscript page from Burroughs'
  short story "to talk for Joe the Dead" from his collection TORNADO ALLEY
  (Cherry Valley, 1989 - provided).  This portion corresponds to pp. 17-18 from
  that edition.Typed and dated April 16, 1983, the piece likely originated from
  Burroughs' journal as several lines at the beginning of the page seem to
  record a dream featuring Allen Ginsberg not mentioned in the published
  version.  Several hand corrections to typescript as well as two informative
  notes to upper and lower margins in Burroughs' hand. The first: "He's going
  to kill his doctor (me)".  The second explains the origins of the story:
  "This is an extension of Jerry Wallace story about a criminal boy 7 feet
  tall.  I said, "He'd better abreviate [sic?] himself".  An uncommon look
  at Burroughs' working methods, even if only in part."
