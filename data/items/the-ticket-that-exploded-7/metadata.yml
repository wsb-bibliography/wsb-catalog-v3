description: >-
  First English. Signed by Burroughs, inscribed "For Brad".  I obtained this
  item from Red Stodolsky of Baroque Books in Hollywood in the late Eighties;
  I remember Red smiling gnomically when he handed it to me, as if he'd
  arranged to get it inscribed for me, but I have no real proof that that was
  the case. Slight tear and rubbing on spine of dust jacket.
