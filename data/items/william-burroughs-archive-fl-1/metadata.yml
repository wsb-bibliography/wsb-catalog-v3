  The typescript of the introductory section of "A Descriptive Catalogue of
  the William S . Burroughs Archive," together with notes on the catalog by
  Brion Gysin on lined notebook paper. Notes slightly yellowed at top, else
  fine. Per James Musser: "GYSIN, Brion.  Gysin's handwritten notes listing
  corrections for The Descriptive Catalog of the William S. Burroughs Archive
  published by Covent Garden in 1973.  3 pages. 4to. Gysin carefully lists,
  page-by-page, suggested corrections to the text of the catalog of
  the Burroughs archive that also included much of his own material.
  TOGETHER WITH two pages of original typescript by Gysin titled "Flyer."
  Gysin's text, never published, was intended to be a promotional flyer
  describing the catalog of the Burroughs archive.  Fine."
