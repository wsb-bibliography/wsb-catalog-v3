  First. Per James Musser: "Contains three original b&w photographs of
  William Burroughs in the Amazon jungle in the 1950s. The photographs were
  taken by an unknown person who accompanied Burroughs on his South American
  expedition to research the use of yage by local curanderos, a journey
  chronicled in The Yage Letters. They show Burroughs in his pith helmet and
  safari clothes, in one photo wielding a machete, in another posing with
  a long rifle, and in the third he's standing with two native children.
  The 5" x 7" photographs are corner-mounted on paper that simulates
  the bark of the Banisteria caapi vine. The pages are bound into covers of
  richly textured, sumptuous hand-made paper bound at the spine with brass
  screws. The booklet was designed and hand-assembled by Johnny Brewton of
  X-Ray Book Co. in an edition limited to only 26 lettered copies.
  The photographs, two of which are previously unpublished, were reproduced
  from the original negatives and are the only prints to be made from these
  negatives. This first publication from Skyline Books is a nice companion to
  The Yage Letters, providing an intriguing look at William Burroughs as
  explorer and ethnobotanist. As new."  Lettered R of 26.
