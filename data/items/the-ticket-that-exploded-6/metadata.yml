  Second printing. Inscribed by Burroughs on title page â€œFor Richard Aaron
  William S. Burroughs." Per Ken Lopez, at one time this was in
  the collection of Robert and Donna Jackson: "Jackson, a book collector long
  before he purchased Burroughs' papers, also acquired a number of
  other copies of Burroughs titles, including ... another group inscribed to
  Richard Aaron, the bookseller who had helped facilitate the sale of
  the [Vaduz] archive."
