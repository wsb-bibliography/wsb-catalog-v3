  First. Per Brewer's Books: "This is one of the separately issued copies with
  no fold creases. Newsprint very tanned penciled price in upper right hand
  corner as it was sold in some bookstores in the '60's for ten cents each. ...
  No copyright at lower edge which according to Maynard and Miles (C124c)
  means it is a 'later state' ..."
