  First. A copy of the record with sleeve originally supplied with the book.
  This copy was purchased from a different source than my copy of the book,
  so there's no evidence that the two constituted a complete set. Since one
  would expect complete sets to stay together, it is unlikely that they
  ever were. But together they form a made-up copy.
