  First. Per James Musser: "The first German edition of The Wild Boys
  (and presumably first German Port of Saints).  Tipped-in frontis illustration
  by S. Clay Wilson whose full-page plates appear throughout the book.
  BURROUGHS' PERSONAL COPY SPECIALLY BOUND for him by the publisher in
  DIAMONDBACK RATTLESNAKE SKIN with Burroughs' initials stamped to the spine.
  Signed on the title page by Burroughs and also by S. Clay Wilson who dated
  his signature 1996.  (Wilson's person copy was bound in Niger goat and
  snakeskin--so depending on how you look at it each copy is unique---or you
  can say there were two specially bound author copies bound by the publisher.)
  Fine in slightly used slightly soiled folding chemise covered in the same
  silk they used for the endpapers."
